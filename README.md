# covid19-dataviz
Adventures and experiments in visualizing covid19 case/death/vaccination data

## Libraries used
Only three libraries needed for this to work
1. `numpy`
2. `pandas`
3. `matplotlib`

## Files needed
Vaccination data is pulled directly from the [OWID repository](https://github.com/owid/covid-19-data/tree/master/public/data/vaccinations). 

Case/Death rates are pulled from a [CSV from the CDC](https://data.cdc.gov/Case-Surveillance/United-States-COVID-19-Cases-and-Deaths-by-State-o/9mfq-cb36). A local version of the file is located in: `covid19-dataviz/United_States_COVID-19_Cases_and_Deaths_by_State_over_Time.csv`

A new one can be downloaded at: https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/9mfq-cb36/rows.csv?accessType=DOWNLOAD
